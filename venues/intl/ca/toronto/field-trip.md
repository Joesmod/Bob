## Opendate Fit

**Score: 55/100 — Likely Not a Fit**

Field Trip is an annual festival (not year-round venue) with significant corporate sponsorship and government funding. The heavy sponsor integration and annual nature make it unlikely to be a good platform switch candidate.

**Pros**:
- Active festival with corporate backing
- Strong partnerships
- Urban, accessible location

**Cons**:
- Annual event only (limited days per year)
- Heavy corporate sponsorship structure
- Likely uses established festival ticketing platform
- Not a venue — no year-round programming
- Outside Opendate's primary US market

**Verdict**: Not a realistic prospect. Annual festivals with this level of corporate integration typically have locked-in ticketing agreements.
