## Opendate Fit

**Score: 55/100 — Likely Not a Fit**

Green Man is a well-established, successful UK festival with sold-out tickets. As an annual festival (not year-round venue), they likely have established ticketing infrastructure with major festival platforms. Their scale, maturity, and UK location make them unlikely to switch platforms.

**Pros**:
- High-demand festival (sold out)
- Strong brand and community
- Multi-faceted programming

**Cons**:
- Annual event only (4 days/year)
- Already established and successful
- UK-based (outside Opendate's primary US market)
- Likely using major festival ticketing provider
- Too large/mature to be a platform switch candidate

**Verdict**: Admire from afar. Not a realistic Opendate prospect.
