## About

Beloved independent music festival held annually at the "Supernatural Amphitheatre" — a permanent outdoor venue in Meredith, Victoria, Australia. The festival celebrated its 33rd edition in December 2025 and will hold its 34th on December 11-13, 2026. Known for BYO alcohol policy, no commercial branding, camping, eclectic lineups, and a fiercely independent spirit. Affectionately referred to as "The Sup'" by attendees.

**Venue**: The Supernatural Amphitheatre (3333) — permanent, purpose-built outdoor amphitheater with natural bowl setting under radiata pines.

## History

Meredith Music Festival began in the early 1990s and has grown into one of Australia's most respected independent festivals. Now in its 34th year, it maintains a subscriber-based ticketing model where previous attendees get priority access. The festival is organized by "Aunty Meredith" (the festival's personified organizing entity) and has cultivated a devoted community over three decades.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 58/100 — Interesting But Likely Not a Fit**

Meredith is a unique, fiercely independent festival with a custom-built subscriber ticketing system. Their anti-commercial ethos and DIY approach suggests they value control and independence over convenience. They appear to have a working custom platform that serves their subscriber-first model.

**Pros**: 
- Active, high-demand festival (sells out annually)
- Strong community/subscriber base
- Well-curated, diverse lineups

**Cons**:
- Already has custom ticketing infrastructure
- Anti-commercial philosophy may resist third-party platforms
- Annual event (not year-round venue)
- Likely very attached to current systems

**Verdict**: Respect from afar. This is a festival that has perfected its model over 33 years. They're not looking for help. Beautiful operation though.
