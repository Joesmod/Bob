## Opendate Fit
**Score: 78/100**

**Strengths:**
- High-frequency programming (4-7 nights/week) = consistent ticket volume
- Already using Eventbrite (easy migration path) and Tablelist for VIP
- Multiple revenue streams: GA tickets, VIP bottle service, food/beverage
- Strong social media presence and branding
- Diverse programming appeals to multiple demographics
- Historic venue with modern amenities creates unique positioning

**Opportunities:**
- Currently using Eventbrite - potential to consolidate ticketing and save on fees
- VIP bottle service handled separately through Tablelist could be integrated
- No clear membership/subscription model for frequent attendees
- Strong social following could benefit from better fan data/CRM integration

**Challenges:**
- Already established ticketing workflow with Eventbrite
- May require demonstrating cost savings or feature advantages
- Nightclub model relies heavily on bottle service revenue (non-ticketing)

**Why Opendate:**
Yost Theater operates at significant scale with frequent events and diverse programming. If Opendate can match or beat Eventbrite's pricing while offering better fan data, integrated VIP management, and streamlined operations, this venue represents a strong conversion opportunity. The venue's professional management and high volume make them an ideal beta partner for nightclub/concert features.
