## Opendate Fit

**Score: 50/100 — Low Priority**

Historic, mission-driven venue with limited commercial ticketing activity visible online. Non-profit structure and Catholic/cultural mission suggest donor-supported model rather than high-volume ticket sales. Rental venue model may mean varied ticketing approaches per production. Limited online ticketing presence suggests they may not be actively seeking new platform. Worth monitoring but not immediate priority.
