## Opendate Fit

**Score: 60/100 — Moderate Prospect**

Small independent bar/venue with live music programming. Website is minimal with little event information visible, which could indicate either low activity or poor digital infrastructure. The venue appears to be more bar-focused than ticketed-event focused. May not be high-volume enough for Opendate's platform unless they're looking to professionalize and scale up their live music operations. Worth following up to understand their event frequency and ticketing approach.

**Note**: The Burlington's online presence is quite limited. Further research or direct outreach would be needed to assess actual event volume and ticketing needs.
