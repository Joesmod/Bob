## Opendate Fit

**Score: 15/100 — Poor Fit**

Not a ticketed entertainment venue. This is a municipal convention center that primarily hosts conferences, trade shows, and community events. Occasional entertainment happens but it's not a music/arts venue with regular ticketed programming. Not an appropriate prospect for Opendate.
