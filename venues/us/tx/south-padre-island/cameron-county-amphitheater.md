## Opendate Fit

**Score: 70/100 — Good Lead**

Active ticketed venue with strong programming and professional operations. Currently on Eventbrite (switchable platform). However, county ownership means procurement/approval processes may be more complex than independent venues. Strong event volume justifies outreach. Spring Break programming shows sophistication in event production and ticketing operations.
