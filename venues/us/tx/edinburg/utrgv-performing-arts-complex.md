## Opendate Fit

**Score: 45/100 — Medium-Low Priority**

University arts presenter using Showpass for ticketing. While they do sell tickets to public events, university venues typically have institutional procurement processes and existing relationships with vendors. Showpass is a well-established platform that integrates with their academic calendar. Switching costs would be high for a public university with bureaucratic approval processes. Limited commercial motivation to switch platforms.
