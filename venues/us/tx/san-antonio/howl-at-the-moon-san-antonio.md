## Opendate Fit
**Score: 10/100 — Not a Fit**
This is a bar/nightclub with live entertainment, not a ticketed venue. Operates on a free admission model with revenue from alcohol sales and table reservations. No advance ticket sales or box office operation. Not aligned with Opendate's ticketing platform use case. Corporate franchise operation means local decision-making is limited.
