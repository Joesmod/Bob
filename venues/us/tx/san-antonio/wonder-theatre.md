## Opendate Fit

**Score: 80/100 — Strong Fit**

Active nonprofit musical theater with educational programming. Currently uses Ovation Tix, a switchable platform. Regular season productions with ticketed shows. Strong candidate for Opendate:
- Educational component (classes, camps) could benefit from integrated registration
- Nonprofit features (donations, memberships, season tickets)
- Active programming year-round
- Already comfortable with third-party ticketing

Small capacity (234 seats) but consistent programming and educational mission suggest stable operation. Youth program creates recurring revenue beyond ticket sales.
