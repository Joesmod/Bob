## Opendate Fit
**Score: 20/100 — Not a Fit**
This is a rental venue owned by a Masonic organization (Scottish Rite), not a professional venue producing ticketed shows. Decision-making controlled by fraternal organization leadership with institutional governance. Does not sell tickets directly—operates as facility rental where individual renters manage their own events and ticketing. Not aligned with Opendate's target market of venues seeking integrated ticketing solutions for their own programming.
