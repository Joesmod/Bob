## About

Historic performing arts venue focused on celebrating diverse cultures with emphasis on African and African-American heritage. City of San Antonio-owned and operated cultural center. Hosts premier artistic presentations, community outreach activities, and educational programs. 226 N. Hackberry location with box office on-site.

## History

Built in 1918 as a community center for African-Americans. Renamed Carver Library and Auditorium in the 1930s in honor of Dr. George Washington Carver. From the 1940s through the Civil Rights Era, the Carver hosted legendary African-American entertainers including Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Cab Calloway, Paul Robeson, and Dizzy Gillespie. 

Fell into neglect by the early 1970s during desegregation. In 1973, when the City moved to demolish the building, community members used their bodies as human shields to protect it from bulldozers. Renovated and reopened in 1977 as the Carver Community Cultural Center under City of San Antonio ownership. Now operates as a special project of the CoSA's Conventions Sports and Entertainment Facilities Department. Over 100 years of continuous service to San Antonio.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 50/100 — Municipal Venue (Lower Priority)**

City-owned cultural center with strong programming and active ticketed events. However, government ownership means procurement process and decision-making is bureaucratic. Not an independent operator that can quickly switch platforms. Ticketing provider not visible on website (may use city system or offline box office). Good cultural mission and active calendar, but likely tied to municipal contracts. Better targets are independent venues with clear ticketing platforms.
