## Opendate Fit
**Score: 15/100 — Not a Fit**
This is a historic movie theater showing second-run films, not a live event venue. While they do private event rentals (weddings, corporate), they don't host ticketed concerts, comedy shows, or live performances. Not a candidate for Opendate's platform.
