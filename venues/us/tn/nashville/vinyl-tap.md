## About

Vinyl Tap is a neighborhood record store and craft beer bar located in East Nashville at 2038 Greenwood Ave. The venue combines vinyl record sales with a curated beer selection in a restored historic building that previously housed a neighborhood grocery store and laundromat. 

The space serves as a community gathering spot celebrating music culture and craft beverages. It's an all-ages establishment until 7 PM, then 21+ with photo ID required for beer purchases. Hours vary: Mon-Tues 3 PM-10 PM, Wed-Thurs Noon-12 AM, Fri-Sat Noon-1 AM, Sunday Noon-11 PM.

Parking is shared with neighbors Schulman's and Cafe Rozè, with street parking available on Greenwood and Porter.

## History

Vinyl Tap is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for founder and ninth-generation Nashvillian Todd Hedrick. Growing up in East Nashville, Todd attended concerts at Municipal Auditorium, Starwood Amphitheater, and the Ryman, spending his youth searching for cassettes, CDs, and vinyl at Tower Records, CATS Records, and the Great Escape.

After attending Father Ryan High School and majoring in Electronic Media at Xavier University, Todd worked in corporate America while dreaming of owning a record store in his hometown. In 2015, the timing aligned: vinyl was making a comeback, craft beer was exploding, and the perfect location was available. With family support and partnership, Todd restored the building and opened Vinyl Tap in November 2016.

The venue has thrived with support from staff and customers, as Todd notes quoting Jerry Garcia: "Once in a while, you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right."

## Opendate Fit

**Not a fit** - Vinyl Tap operates as a record store and craft beer bar, not a ticketed music venue:

- **Retail/bar model** - Revenue from vinyl sales and beverage service, not tickets
- **No performance space** - Focused on music appreciation (vinyl) rather than live shows
- **Community gathering spot** - Neighborhood hangout, not event-driven venue
- **All-ages until 7 PM** - Family-friendly retail space

This is not a venue that would benefit from ticketing services. Better prospects are dedicated performance spaces, comedy clubs, or theaters with regular ticketed programming.
