## Research Status

**DATA QUALITY ISSUE - WRONG LOCATION**

This venue is incorrectly listed as being in Nashville, TN in the source data. Evidence shows it's actually in New York state:

- Phone number: 845-726-3956 (Hudson Valley, NY area code)
- Serves Appalachian Trail hikers (AT passes through NY, not Nashville)
- Website mentions filling water bottles for AT thru-hikers

## Venue Type

Restaurant/tavern, not a ticketed performance venue. Services include:
- Indoor dining and takeout
- Appalachian Trail hiker support
- No mention of live music or events

## Recommended Actions

1. Correct location data in source sheet
2. Investigate actual NY location
3. Reclassify as restaurant (likely not a ticketing venue)

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Wrong location + wrong venue type**

Location data is incorrect, and venue appears to be a restaurant/tavern without ticketed events.
