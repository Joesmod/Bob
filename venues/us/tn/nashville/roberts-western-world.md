## About

**DATA ERROR IN SHEET**: The website listed (worldnightclubclt.com) is for "World Nightclub" in Charlotte, NC, NOT this Nashville venue.

Roberts Western World is a famous honky-tonk on lower Broadway in Nashville known for live country music, fried bologna sandwiches, and authentic Nashville atmosphere. The correct website should be robertswesternworld.com.

World Nightclub Charlotte: International DJ talent, nightclub programming, corporate events, capacity up to 1000. Uses sophisticated audio/video/lighting. Not the same venue.
