## Opendate Fit

**Potential:** Low to Medium

- **Established system:** TPAC operates its own sophisticated box office system
- **Scale:** Major performing arts center with dedicated infrastructure
- **Programming:** Primarily Broadway tours and traditional performing arts
- **Institution:** State-affiliated cultural institution with established processes
- **Decision-making:** Complex organizational structure

**Assessment:** TPAC is a well-established institution with robust ticketing infrastructure. They likely have long-term contracts and institutional relationships that make switching costly. Better opportunities may exist with smaller independent venues or emerging spaces.

**Core Values noted:**
- Inclusion
- Creative Excellence
- Innovation
- Collaboration
- Purposeful Service

Their emphasis on innovation could present partnership opportunities for enhanced ticketing experiences.
