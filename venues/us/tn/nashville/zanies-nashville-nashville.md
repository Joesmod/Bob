## About

Zanies Nashville is a legendary comedy club that has been a pillar of laughter and a beacon for comedic talent for over 40 years. Located at 2025 8th Avenue South, it's become one of the hottest comedy clubs in the United States. The venue features a main room and recently added "The Lab at Zanies" next door at 2019 8th Avenue South—an intimate 100-seat theater that opened in Spring 2024.

The Lab serves as a creative incubator for emerging comedy talent, offering everything from one-man shows to improv and sketch comedy. It includes dedicated rooms for teaching comedy and improv classes for both aspiring comedians and corporate team-building. In summer 2024, Zanies launched the Zanies Podcast Network to broadcast Nashville's vibrant comedy scene to a global audience.

## History

Zanies has been operating in Nashville for over 40 years, establishing itself as a foundational venue in the comedy landscape. As demand and talent grew beyond what the original venue could contain, Zanies made the strategic decision to expand "smaller" by opening The Lab at Zanies in Spring 2024—creating a more intimate space for raw, unfiltered comedy and talent development.

## Opendate Fit

**Strong candidate** - Zanies is a well-established comedy club with 40+ years of history and robust programming. Key opportunities:

- **Two venues** means double the inventory and potential partnership value
- **Diverse programming** from national headliners to local showcases
- **Educational component** (comedy classes) shows community investment
- **Already ticketed** via Etix - would need to assess contract flexibility
- **High volume** operation with multiple shows weekly across two rooms
- **Strong brand** - part of Zanies network (also in Chicago, Rosemont)

Main consideration: As an established venue with Etix already in place, would need competitive pricing/features to consider switching. The Lab's newer operation might be more flexible.
