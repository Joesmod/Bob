## About

**NOT AN ACTUAL VENUE** — This is an event aggregator/ticketing website (nashville-tn.events) that lists events across Nashville. Similar to Ticketmaster or StubHub, it's a ticket marketplace/calendar, not a physical venue.

The website aggregates 1500+ events from actual Nashville venues like Grand Ole Opry, Ryman Auditorium, Bridgestone Arena, etc. It appears to be a ticket resale/affiliate site.
