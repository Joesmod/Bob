## About

Cannery Hall is a multi-venue complex in Nashville housed in a historic building. The facility includes four distinct event spaces: Mainstage (1,275 capacity), The Mil (550 capacity), Row One Stage (300 capacity), and Amaranth (380 capacity). Each space offers modern production capabilities while maintaining the building's historic character with red brick walls, exposed ceilings, and original hardwood floors.

The complex serves both as an active concert venue hosting local and touring acts across multiple genres, and as a private event space for weddings, corporate events, and special occasions.

## History

Historic building in Nashville, renovated and opened as Cannery Hall with state-of-the-art concert and event facilities. The Mainstage features back-of-house amenities comparable to arena tours, including laundry service, rehearsal rooms, production offices, and multiple green rooms.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 75/100 — Strong Prospect**

**Pros:**
- Active multi-venue operation with consistent show calendar
- Currently using AXS (large provider but potentially switchable for right offer)
- Multiple revenue streams (concerts + private events)
- Professional operation with modern production capabilities
- Strong social media presence and marketing

**Cons:**
- Already integrated with AXS, a major ticketing provider (switching friction)
- Multi-venue complexity may require more sophisticated platform features
- Likely has existing contract with AXS

**Recommendation:** Worth pursuing, but expect longer sales cycle due to AXS integration. Best angle: highlight features AXS lacks (better data/analytics, lower fees, integrated marketing tools). May be better fit once Opendate has proven track record with similarly-sized multi-venue operations.
