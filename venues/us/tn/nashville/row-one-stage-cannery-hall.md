## Opendate Fit

**Potential:** Low

- **Current system:** Already using AXS, a major ticketing platform
- **Scale:** Multi-space venue with professional operations
- **Integration:** AXS provides established infrastructure
- **Contract:** Likely has existing ticketing agreement with AXS
- **Market segment:** Mid-to-large venue focused on touring acts

**Assessment:** Cannery Hall (including Row One Stage) is already deeply integrated with AXS for ticketing. AXS is a major competitor in the ticketing space with established contracts and infrastructure. The venue's professional operations and scale suggest they have negotiated rates and support from AXS.

**Barriers:**
- Existing AXS contract (likely multi-year)
- Multiple venues to coordinate
- Professional event management already in place
- Switching costs would be substantial

**Verdict:** Not a strong prospect for Opendate in the near term. Focus on smaller independent venues without major ticketing platform contracts. Could revisit if/when their AXS contract is up for renewal, but would require competitive pricing and features.
