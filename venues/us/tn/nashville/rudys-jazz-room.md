## About

Rudy's Jazz Room is Nashville's premier authentic jazz club, widely considered among the top jazz clubs in the world. Located in the Gulch, it embodies the history and spirit of traditional jazz clubs with an intimate, late-night listening room experience. The club features a "New York City meets New Orleans" vibe similar to legendary venues like Smalls Jazz Club.

The listening room was built with meticulous attention to acoustics by renowned acoustic designer Michael Cronin, featuring a beautiful Steinway Model B grand piano. The space is designed to be dark, warm, intimate, and eclectic—perfect for serious listening. Combined with world-class jazz performances, fine New Orleans cuisine, and exquisite drinks, Rudy's offers a unique experience unrivaled in Nashville.

## History

Rudy's Jazz Room opened in 2017, filling a long-standing void in Nashville's music scene for an authentic jazz club. Co-owner Adam Charney, having grown up in Nashville and spent time at favorite jazz clubs in New York City, recognized the need for a true jazz venue to fully allow Nashville to live up to its "Music City" name. With longtime friend Michael Braden, they created Rudy's to raise Nashville to the level of other great jazz cities like New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Kansas City.

The club received strong support from Nashville's jazz community and has since become a beacon for the flourishing local jazz scene.
