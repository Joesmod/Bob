## About

The Twelve Thirty Club is a multi-level dining, cocktail, and music destination located at 550 Broadway in Nashville. The venue features three distinct spaces: a Rooftop, a Supper Club, and a Honky Tonk, each with its own atmosphere and hours. 

Designed by award-winning New York interior design firm AVRO|KO—premier architectural tastemakers known for designs that transcend the expected—the space features elaborate Art Deco influences and transcendent architecture. AVRO|KO's designs are characterized by a unique convergence between ideals of the past and an off-beat, forward-looking sensibility, making it the perfect match for this Prohibition-era-inspired concept.

Valet service is available in front of Eddie V's.

## History

The inspiration for The Twelve Thirty Club is rooted in the supper clubs of the 19th century, when closing time for pubs and restaurants was 12:30 AM. These supper clubs could stay open later than other establishments because they were deemed private, becoming dynamic, multi-cultural destinations for music, entertainment, and revelry. 

Often elaborate, these grand Art Deco palaces were where "the pampered sons of fortune met the bohemian avant-garde upon a common level to engage in revelry." The venue was commissioned by Sam and friends to recreate this historical experience for modern Nashville.

## Opendate Fit

**Low priority** - The Twelve Thirty Club operates as an upscale restaurant/bar complex with music, not a ticketed venue:

**Considerations:**
- **Restaurant-first model** - Revenue from dining/drinks, not ticket sales
- **Reservation-based** - Uses Tripleseat for private events, not ticketing platform
- **Ambient entertainment** - Music enhances dining experience rather than being the draw
- **Multiple concepts** - Three different spaces (Rooftop, Supper Club, Honky Tonk) under one roof
- **High-end positioning** - Art Deco design by AVRO|KO suggests premium dining focus
- **Broadway location** - Tourist foot traffic rather than event-driven attendance

This venue is better suited to OpenTable/Resy-style dining reservations than Opendate's ticketing model. Could potentially work for special ticketed events (live performances, comedy nights) but would need to assess if that aligns with their dining-focused brand.
