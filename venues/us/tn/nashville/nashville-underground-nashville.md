## About

Nashville Underground is a massive 55,000-square-foot, 6-story restaurant, bar, and entertainment complex on historic Broadway. The venue features the largest multi-level double-deck rooftop on Broadway, offering panoramic views of downtown Nashville and the Cumberland River. 

The venue includes multiple full bars pouring the coldest draft beer in Nashville (served at 29 degrees), a full restaurant featuring Southern cuisine with locally sourced ingredients, bowling lanes, arcade games, and a mechanical bull. The facility boasts the largest capacity of any single venue on historic Broadway, accommodating groups from 20 to 1,400.

Nashville Underground is family-friendly by day and transitions to 21+ after 9 PM nightly. Named a Top 20 Celebrity-Owned Restaurant by The Food Network.

## History

Nashville Underground was founded and is owned by brothers Joey DeGraw and Gavin DeGraw (the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter behind hits like "I Don't Want to Be" and "Chariot"). The venue has become a cornerstone of Broadway's entertainment scene, combining authentic Nashville experiences with entertainment innovation. Recently added a brand new third floor with bowling lanes, arcade games, and additional entertainment options.

## Opendate Fit

**Low-to-medium priority** - Nashville Underground is primarily a high-volume restaurant/bar with entertainment:

**Pros:**
- **Massive capacity** (up to 1,400) means high revenue potential if converted to ticketed events
- **Celebrity ownership** (Gavin DeGraw) brings credibility and draw
- **Strong brand** and high visibility on Broadway
- **Diverse programming** potential across multiple floors

**Cons:**
- **Walk-in business model** - Current revenue from food/beverage, not tickets
- **High operational complexity** - 6 floors, multiple concepts under one roof
- **Tourist-focused** - Relies on Broadway foot traffic more than event-driven attendance
- **Free admission culture** may be hard to shift

**Assessment:** Could work for special ticketed events (comedy shows, concerts) on specific floors while maintaining walk-in restaurant service on others. Would need to explore hybrid model rather than full ticketing conversion.
