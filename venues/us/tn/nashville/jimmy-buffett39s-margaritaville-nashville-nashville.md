## Opendate Fit

**Low priority** - Margaritaville operates on a fundamentally different business model:

- **No ticketing** - Free admission, revenue from food/beverage
- **Restaurant-first** - Music is ambient entertainment, not the primary draw
- **Corporate chain** - Part of large hospitality brand with centralized operations
- **Tourist destination** - Targets Broadway foot traffic, not dedicated concert-goers
- **Background music programming** - Intimate acoustic sets to complement dining

This venue doesn't align with Opendate's ticketed event model. The performers are paid by the venue as atmosphere, not drawing crowds through ticket sales. Better fit would be dedicated music venues or comedy clubs with actual ticketing infrastructure and event-driven attendance.
