## About

Historic opera house and performing arts center founded in 1901. Survived a major fire in 1923 and was rebuilt in 1924. Now operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called the Historic Everett Theatre Preservation Society. Features concerts, silent movies with pipe organ, and diverse entertainment programming.

## History

Built in 1901 by architect Charles Herbert Bebb for the Everett Improvement Company. Opening night featured "The Casino Girl" musical. The theater hosted legendary performers including Al Jolson, George M. Cohan, Lon Chaney, Lillian Russell, and Helen Keller in its early years.

On December 11, 1923, a devastating fire gutted the interior. Architect Fitzherbert Leather redesigned the building with a new Renaissance facade, and it reopened August 29, 1924. The theater transitioned from vaudeville and live acts to motion pictures in 1918, then back to diverse live programming in recent decades.

The nonprofit preservation society was formed to continue the 124-year tradition of providing arts, entertainment, and education to Snohomish County.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 65/100 — Moderate Fit**

Historic venue with strong community ties and active programming. Currently uses a custom/white-labeled ticketing system via Theatre Concert Consulting rather than a major third-party platform. As a nonprofit with educational mission, they may have specific needs around donor management and community engagement. The custom system suggests they value control, but could benefit from Opendate's integrated approach if it supports nonprofit features (donations, memberships, education programs).

Worth exploring if they're satisfied with current provider or seeking more flexibility.
