## Opendate Fit

**Score: 10/100 — Not a Good Fit**

Large corporate-operated arena theater managed by Oak View Group as part of the Climate Pledge Arena complex. Major venue using established national ticketing platforms (likely Ticketmaster/AEG). Far too large and corporate for Opendate's independent venue focus. Ticketing decisions made at corporate level by Oak View Group, not locally. Not a viable prospect.
