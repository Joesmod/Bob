## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Not a Venue**

This is a church, not a performance venue or ticketed event space. Not relevant for ticketing platform outreach. Included in database due to being flagged as "venue" in lead pipeline but should be removed from venue prospects. Churches that occasionally host concerts typically don't have commercial ticketing operations.
