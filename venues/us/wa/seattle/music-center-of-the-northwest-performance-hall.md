## Opendate Fit
**Score: 10/100 — Not a Fit**
This is a nonprofit music education school, not a commercial performance venue. They host free student recitals and community performances, not ticketed concerts or shows. Their performance hall may be available for rental, but the organization itself doesn't operate as a ticketed event venue. Not a candidate for Opendate's platform.
