## About

Locally-owned performing arts venue featuring stand-up, improv, and sketch comedy. 140-seat cabaret-style showroom with full bar and food menu. Also operates Happy Place Café (daytime coffee shop, Wed-Sun 8am-3pm). Affiliated with Vermont Comedy Arts nonprofit for educational programming.

## History

Founded in 2015 by husband-and-wife team Nathan Hartswick and Natalie Miller. The pair started producing comedy shows in 2010 at various venues around Vermont (bowling alleys, bars, church basements) and teaching comedy classes at their "Spark Arts" studio starting in 2011. They also created the Green Mountain Comedy Festival and Vermont's Funniest Comedian Contest.

After years of planning and a successful $30k Kickstarter campaign in 2014, they raised over $500k to renovate the historic Armory Building at 101 Main St. The venue opened November 2015 with a 150-seat showroom, lounge, classroom, and full food/drink service.

During COVID-19, the club closed March 13, 2020 and stayed closed for 18 months, offering online shows and classes. Reopened September 2021 with renovations and the addition of Happy Place Café for daytime community use.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 85/100 — Strong Fit**

Excellent candidate for Opendate:

**Strengths**:
- Independent owner-operators (Nathan & Natalie) with direct decision authority
- Active programming (5 shows/week) = consistent ticket sales
- Uses SeatEngine (switchable platform)
- Multiple revenue streams: tickets, classes, café, corporate events, Patreon
- Educational nonprofit component (Vermont Comedy Arts)
- Mission-driven small business focused on accessibility and community
- Survived COVID through community support - values relationships

**Perfect Fit Because**:
- Classes/workshops need registration management (could integrate)
- Gift cards and memberships already part of business model
- Patreon suggests they value direct fan relationships (Opendate's community features)
- Corporate events = group sales features
- Small enough to be agile, established enough to be stable

This is exactly the type of independent, mission-driven venue Opendate should target. Owners came from grassroots background and built the venue from scratch - they'll appreciate a platform that supports their values.
