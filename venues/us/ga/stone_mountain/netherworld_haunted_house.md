## Opendate Fit
**Score: 25/100 — Likely Not a Fit**

Haunted houses are typically seasonal attractions (September-October) with limited operating window. Even if operational, they usually:
- Operate 1-2 months per year
- Have very specific attraction ticketing needs
- Often use carnival/attraction ticketing systems
- Limited year-round use case for platform

**Challenges:**
- Seasonal operation (not year-round)
- Attraction ticketing vs. event ticketing
- Website appears offline
- May be defunct or only seasonally active

**Next Steps if pursuing:**
- Verify if venue is still operational
- Check for social media presence
- Determine operating season
- Find correct website or contact information

**Note:** Attractions category venues are generally lower priority than year-round performance venues and ticketed event spaces.
