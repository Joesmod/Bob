## Opendate Fit
**Score: 15/100 — Not a Fit**
County-owned public park facility operated by Palm Beach County Parks & Recreation department. Decision-making controlled by government bureaucracy with formal procurement processes. Does not sell tickets directly—operates as rental venue where individual producers manage their own ticketing. Not aligned with Opendate's target market of independent venues seeking integrated ticketing solutions. Government contracts are slow, complex, and low-priority targets.
