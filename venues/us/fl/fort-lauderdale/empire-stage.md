## Opendate Fit
**Score: 50/100 — Uncertain Fit**

Theater appears active based on reviews but website has minimal event listings and no visible ticketing integration. Events page is essentially empty. May do in-person box office sales or email reservations. Would need direct outreach to understand their current ticketing setup and volume. The intimate blackbox format and alternative programming could work with Opendate, but unclear event frequency and ticketing needs make this a lower-priority lead without more information.
