## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Not a Good Fit**

Operated by Ruth Eckerd Hall, a major performing arts center with established ticketing infrastructure. As part of a larger arts organization, ticketing decisions would be made at the organizational level, not for individual venues. Not an independent operator. Would require engaging with Ruth Eckerd Hall leadership, not this specific venue.
