## Opendate Fit

**Score: 5/100 — Not a Good Fit**

College campus amphitheater for student events, not a commercial ticketed venue. University-managed facility primarily used for free campus programming. No commercial ticketing operation. Not a viable prospect for a commercial ticketing platform. Would fall under university procurement if they ever needed ticketing, which is unlikely for this type of facility.
