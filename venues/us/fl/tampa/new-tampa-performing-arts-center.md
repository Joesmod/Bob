## Opendate Fit
**Score: 75/100 — Strong Prospect**
Active 354-seat venue with high event volume (100+ events/year). Currently using Eventbrite—prime candidate for platform switch. Mix of presenting and rental makes ticketing needs complex. Good ticket volume and price points. Modern facility with professional operations. Would benefit significantly from integrated ticketing + marketing platform vs. Eventbrite's generic approach.
