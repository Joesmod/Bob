## Opendate Fit
**Score: 25/100 — Not a Fit**
This is an academic theater space within a university theater department, not a commercial ticketed venue. Primary function is education and student production showcasing. Ticketing decisions controlled by university administration with institutional procurement requirements. Not aligned with Opendate's target market of independent professional venues optimizing commercial ticketing.
