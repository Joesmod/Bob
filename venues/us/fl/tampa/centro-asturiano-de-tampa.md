## History

Founded May 1902 by 546 Asturian immigrants from Havana, Cuba as a mutual aid society providing medical benefits and social services. Branch of Centro Asturiano de La Habana (est. 1886). Original wood-frame building on 7th Avenue, moved to Palm and Nebraska in impressive building. After fire, current three-story yellow brick building designed by Bonfoey and Elliot was built for $110,000. Newspaper called it "the most beautiful building in the South."

Historic theater hosted international stars including Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona. Featured zarzuelas (Spanish musical theater) that drew such acclaim that Spanish publication El Arte de Teatro sent a full-time writer to cover productions. Club offered gymnasium, cantina, billiards, bowling, library, educational rooms, ballroom - serving as community center "from cradle to grave" for Asturian immigrant families.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 35/100 — Marginal Fit**

**Why Limited Fit**:
- **Event rental model** - Primary business is renting space for weddings/corporate events
- **No regular programming** - Not a venue with a ticketed season/schedule
- **Client-driven ticketing** - When events happen, the renter handles ticketing (not the venue)
- **Historic preservation focus** - Currently fundraising for theater restoration

**Considerations**:
- Beautiful historic venue with compelling story
- Some performance programming (comedy, musicals, recitals) but irregular
- May host ticketed events occasionally, but not core business model
- Venue rental clients (wedding planners, event coordinators) handle their own ticketing

**Reality**: This is a gorgeous historic building operating as an event rental venue, not a traditional performance venue with a regular ticketed season. While they do occasionally host comedy shows and recitals, the business model is venue rental. Unless they pivot to more regular programming, they're not a strong Opendate customer. The theater restoration fundraising suggests potential future programming, but not current.
