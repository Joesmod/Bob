## Opendate Fit
**Score: 70/100 — Warm Lead**

Active, professional opera company with diverse programming and strong ticket sales. Currently using Ovation Tix (switchable platform). Produces 10+ shows annually with good variety. Broadway Cabaret sells out consistently, indicating strong audience. Would benefit from integrated platform for multiple show types and venues. Challenge: may have existing contract with Ovation Tix. Strong community presence and donor base suggest financial stability.
