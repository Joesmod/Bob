## Opendate Fit

**Score: 75/100 — Good Lead**

Active comedy club with regular ticketed shows and classes. Currently using basic Squarespace commerce tools for ticketing. Independent operation with multiple revenue streams (shows, classes, corporate events). Good candidate for Opendate's platform — would benefit from professional ticketing features, better analytics, and marketing tools. Established venue with strong community presence.
