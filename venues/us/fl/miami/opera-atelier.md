## Opendate Fit
**Score: 55/100 — Medium Priority**

Education-focused organization with performance component. Heavy emphasis on training programs, summer camps, and community engagement. Performance schedule appears limited (1-2 major productions per season). Revenue likely split between tuition and ticket sales. Mission-driven nonprofit with strong educational focus may prioritize values over platform features. Would need to understand their current ticketing setup and volume. Good community presence and diverse programming, but educational focus may limit ticketing platform potential.
