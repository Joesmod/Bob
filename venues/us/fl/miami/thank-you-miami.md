## Opendate Fit
**Score: 20/100 — Not a Fit**

This is a restaurant/bar with free entertainment, not a ticketed venue. Revenue comes from food and beverage sales, not ticket sales. Comedy and music are complimentary amenities to drive traffic. No evidence of ticketed events. While they host entertainment, it's not structured as a ticketing business. Not a viable Opendate prospect unless they shift to a ticketed comedy club model.
