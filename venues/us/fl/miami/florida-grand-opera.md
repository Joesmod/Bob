## Opendate Fit
**Score: 30/100 — Poor Fit**
Opera company, not a venue operator. They rent large performing arts centers (Arsht Center, Broward Center) for productions. Different model from typical ticketed venue—they're the presenting organization, not the facility. Budget would be allocated to major established opera ticketing platforms integrated with orchestra/donor management systems. Not a target customer for Opendate.
