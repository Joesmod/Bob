## Opendate Fit

**Score: 15/100 — Not a Good Fit**

Municipal/community center, likely operated by City of Miami. Website inaccessible for research. Government-operated facilities typically use established procurement processes and ticketing contracts, making them difficult prospects for new platforms. Would require engaging with city government bureaucracy.
