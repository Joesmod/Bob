## Opendate Fit
**Score: 40/100 — Low Priority**
University-affiliated performing arts center. While they host ticketed events, this is an academic facility primarily serving FIU students, faculty, and university programming. Decision-making likely controlled by university administration with complex procurement processes. Focus is on education and community engagement rather than commercial ticketing optimization. Better targets exist among independent professional venues.
