## Opendate Fit

**Score: 55/100 — Lower Priority**

Entertainment complex focused on drag/cabaret shows and nightlife. Currently using FareHarbor for reservations. Business model appears more bar/restaurant-focused with shows as amenity rather than primary ticketing operation. May not have high ticketing volume. Multi-venue setup could benefit from integrated system, but entertainment focus differs from typical Opendate targets.
