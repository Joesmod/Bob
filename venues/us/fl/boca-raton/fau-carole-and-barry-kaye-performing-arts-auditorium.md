## About

**⚠️ RESEARCH BLOCKED:** Website is broken (404 error). The listed URL http://www.fau.edu/kayeauditorium returns a "Page Not Found" error. Attempted to locate alternative URLs within FAU's website but could not find a working page for this venue.

This is a university-owned performing arts venue at Florida Atlantic University. Based on the address and phone number, it appears to be a legitimate facility, but without a functioning website, detailed research on programming, ticketing, and operations cannot be completed.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Very Low Fit**

**Assessment:** Unable to properly assess due to broken website. However, as a university-owned venue, this would likely be:
- Government/institutional operation with complex procurement processes
- Potentially using university-wide systems
- Low autonomy for ticketing decisions

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue until/unless website is restored and venue can be properly researched. University venues are generally poor fits for independent ticketing platforms.
