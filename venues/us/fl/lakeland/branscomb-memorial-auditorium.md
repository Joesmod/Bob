## Opendate Fit
**Score: 45/100 — Low Priority**

College venue with heavily subsidized tickets ($5-20) and free admission for students/staff. Educational mission and institutional budget likely make platform switching unlikely. Low ticket prices suggest minimal revenue focus. Would need college administration buy-in.
