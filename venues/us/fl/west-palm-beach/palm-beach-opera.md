## Opendate Fit
**Score: 25/100 — Poor Fit**
Opera presenting organization, not a venue. Rents major performing arts centers for productions. Different business model—they produce shows at third-party venues. Ticketing integrated with donor CRM and high-end patron management systems. Budget allocated to established opera/symphony ticketing platforms. Not a target for Opendate.
