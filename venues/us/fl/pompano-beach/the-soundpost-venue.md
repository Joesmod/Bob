## Opendate Fit

**Score: 45/100 — Mixed Potential**

Venue advertises concerts and comedy shows as event types, suggesting possible ticketed programming. However, website navigation indicates "UPCOMING EVENTS" section but those pages return 404 errors. Unclear if they actively host ticketed public events or primarily focus on private rentals. Would need direct contact to confirm their ticketing needs and event frequency.

**Recommendation**: Contact venue to clarify their public vs. private event split and current ticketing setup.
