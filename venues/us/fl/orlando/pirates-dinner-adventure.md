## Opendate Fit
**Score: 5/100 — Not a Good Fit**
Corporate dinner theater with single fixed show format. Not a venue that books rotating acts, concerts, or varied programming. Tourist attraction model, not an independent venue needing ticketing platform. Similar to Medieval Times or other theme dinner shows — not a suitable Opendate candidate.
