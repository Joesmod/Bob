## Opendate Fit
**Score: N/A — Requires Further Research**

Cannot accurately assess without access to official venue information. The Bob Carr is part of the larger Dr. Phillips Center complex, which likely has institutional ticketing arrangements. Would need to research Dr. Phillips Center directly to understand their ticketing setup, programming, and decision-making structure.

**Next steps**: Research Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts as the parent organization.
