## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Not a Fit**

This is a private event rental space operated by a Jewish Community Center, not a ticketed live entertainment venue. They do not sell tickets to public shows. Focus is on facility rentals for private events (weddings, corporate gatherings, etc.). Not a viable lead for ticketing platform.
