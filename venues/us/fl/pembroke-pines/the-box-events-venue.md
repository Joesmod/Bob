## Opendate Fit
**Score: 70/100 — Good Lead**
Active ticketed venue with regular programming. Currently using TicketPlate for ticketing. Niche Latin/Hispanic market focus. Could benefit from Opendate's platform, especially if expansion beyond Spanish-language shows is planned. Independent operation, good event frequency.
