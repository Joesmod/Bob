## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Not Applicable**

This is not an independent venue. It's a Disney World theme park attraction that is part of the park's admission - no separate ticketing. Owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company with proprietary ticketing systems fully integrated into Disney's ecosystem. Not a lead for Opendate.
