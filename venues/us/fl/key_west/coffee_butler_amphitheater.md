## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Unlikely**

Already using AXS, which is a major enterprise ticketing platform. Professionally managed by Rams Head/AEG, so ticketing decisions likely made at corporate level. Would require upper-level relationship with promotion company rather than direct venue approach.

**Challenges:**
- Corporate ticketing already in place
- Managed by large promotion companies
- Enterprise-level venue

**Notes:**
- Well-established venue with professional operations
- Strong social media presence
- Active concert calendar with major heritage acts
