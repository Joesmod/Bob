## Opendate Fit
**Score: 55/100 — Moderate Lead**
Historic venue in small Florida town with good community engagement (4.5★, 284 reviews). Currently using Square platform which is basic but switchable. Limited online presence makes it difficult to assess event volume and ticketing sophistication. Small market venue - may benefit from better ticketing platform but decision-making process and volume unknown. Worth follow-up contact to learn more about their operation.

**Note**: Website has minimal public content. Direct outreach needed to understand their programming, event frequency, and ticketing needs.
