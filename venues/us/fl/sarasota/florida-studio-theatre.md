## Opendate Fit
**Score: 70/100 — Good Prospect**
Highly professional operation. Largest subscription theater in Florida (230K attendees/year). Current ticketing via "Made" platform. Strong subscription model which requires robust CRM. Five venues = complex scheduling. Established org with budget for quality systems. However, subscription-heavy model means they need deep integration with renewals, member benefits, and donor tracking—would need to evaluate if Opendate handles subscription management well.
