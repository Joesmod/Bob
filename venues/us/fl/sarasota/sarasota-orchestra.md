## Opendate Fit

**Score: 25/100 — Low Priority**

Established symphony orchestra with existing ticketing infrastructure (buy.sarasotaorchestra.org subdomain). Non-profit arts organization with board governance and development programs. Orchestra subscription model differs from typical venue operations. Planning major capital campaign for new concert hall, so ticketing platform changes unlikely during that critical period. Better fit for specialized arts organization platforms than general venue ticketing.
