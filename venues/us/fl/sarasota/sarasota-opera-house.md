## Opendate Fit

**Score: 30/100 — Low Priority**

Sarasota Opera runs their own sophisticated in-house ticketing platform with mobile app integration. As a professional opera company with an established ticketing infrastructure, subscriptions, and donor management, they are unlikely to switch to a new platform. Their needs are highly specialized for opera season planning, subscription management, and donor cultivation. Not a good fit for Opendate.
