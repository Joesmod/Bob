## Opendate Fit
**Score: 45/100 — Moderate Fit (Education/Attraction)**

Active ticketing for tours and special events, but as a nonprofit historic site with educational mission, likely has specialized needs and institutional ticketing relationships. Many events are "included with admission" rather than separately ticketed.

**Pros:**
- Sells tickets online for tours and special events
- Active calendar of ticketed programming
- Wednesday Nights series has separate admission ($17-20)
- Halloween Nights seasonal programming
- Group visit bookings

**Cons:**
- Nonprofit museum/educational institution
- Mission-driven organization, not commercial venue
- Many programs free/included with admission
- Likely has institutional partnerships for ticketing
- May have specific nonprofit/educational platform needs

**Notes:**
- Strong educational programming and social impact mission
- Major tourist attraction in Philadelphia
- Well-developed visitor experience infrastructure
- Active event calendar with variety of programming
