## About

Part of Portland'5 Centers for the Arts, one of the fifth-largest performing arts centers in the United States. Keller Auditorium stands as Portland's grand stage for Broadway hits, opera masterpieces, and dance spectaculars. The venue retains its midcentury charm while hosting the city's biggest productions with a scale and spirit that make it a cornerstone of Portland's performing arts scene.

Portland'5 operates five venues total and brings over 800 performances annually to Portland's Cultural District, generating $60 million in regional economic impact and serving over 1 million patrons per year.

## History

Originally opened in 1917 as the Portland Public Auditorium, the venue reopened in 1968 as the Civic Auditorium before becoming known as Keller Auditorium. Named for civic philanthropists Richard B. and Helen L. Keller, whose generosity helped restore and sustain the venue. The theater has evolved from a civic gathering place into a destination for world-class entertainment.

**Note:** Portland'5 is currently City of Portland-owned and Metro-managed. A management transition to full City control is planned for summer 2027 to simplify governance and address capital funding challenges.

- **Frequency**: Part of 800+ annual Portland'5 performances

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 40/100 — Low Fit**

**Challenges:**
- Government-operated (City-owned, Metro-managed) — not an independent venue
- Large institutional operation with in-house ticketing infrastructure
- Part of 5th-largest performing arts center in US — likely has established systems
- Management transition underway (Metro → City, summer 2027) — major organizational change
- Capital funding challenges and deferred maintenance noted in transition planning

**Positives:**
- High event volume (part of 800+ annual shows)
- Strong community presence and economic impact
- Professional operation serving 1M+ patrons/year

**Assessment:** While Keller Auditorium hosts significant ticketed events, it's part of a large government-operated performing arts complex unlikely to switch ticketing providers. The ongoing management transition and institutional nature make this a poor prospect for Opendate.
