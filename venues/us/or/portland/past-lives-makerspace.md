## Opendate Fit
**Score: 0/100 — Not a Fit**

Past Lives is a membership-based makerspace, not a ticketed event venue. While they host occasional classes, gallery openings, and community events, these are not regular ticketed performances. Their revenue model is membership fees and commissioned work, not ticket sales. This venue does not match Opendate's target profile as a ticketing platform. Should be removed from the venue lead pipeline.

**Recommendation**: Remove from sheet or mark as "Not a venue."
