## Opendate Fit

**Score: 40/100 — Low Priority**

Small intimate venue with acoustic focus. Limited event calendar information visible on website. Educational mission (partnering with culinary/media schools) suggests non-profit or mission-driven operation that may not prioritize ticketing platform sophistication. Unclear ticketing volume and current provider. Would need more information about event frequency and ticketing needs.
