## Opendate Fit

**Score: 70/100 — Moderate-Good Fit**

Historic music venue with strong programming and regional reputation. Part of McMenamins corporate family, which may complicate decision-making:

**Strengths**:
- Active concert schedule
- Established venue with loyal following
- Professional operation

**Challenges**:
- Corporate ownership (McMenamins is a large regional chain)
- May have corporate ticketing contracts
- Decision authority likely at corporate level, not venue level
- Possible existing relationships with major ticketing platforms

Best approach: Determine if McMenamins handles ticketing at corporate level or if individual venues have autonomy. If corporate, would need to pitch McMenamins organization as a whole (they operate ~50+ properties across OR/WA).
