## About

Sweet Harmony Canal is a unique community gathering space combining a bar, live music venue, and curated vintage shop in downtown Canal Winchester (suburb of Columbus). Located in a converted historic South Central Power building, the venue was created by the Smith family during COVID as a "community's living room" — a place for connection, music, and celebration.

The space is filled with thrifted treasures, rustic tables, vintage chairs, and well-worn sofas designed to encourage lingering. Everything with a price tag can be purchased and taken home. The venue hosts live music, private events, and serves craft cocktails and coffee.

**Philosophy:** "Big space. Cozy soul. A place for music, connection, and the simple feeling that you belong."

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 70/100 — Qualified Lead**

**Pros:**
- Active ticketed venue using Eventim (switchable platform)
- Family-owned/operated (direct decision-making)
- Community-focused mission aligns with Opendate values
- Owner identified (Kendra Smith) — clear contact path
- Multi-purpose space (music + private events = diverse revenue)
- Unique concept (vintage shop integration) = local following
- Booking email available

**Cons:**
- Suburban location (Canal Winchester) = smaller market than downtown Columbus
- Relatively new venue (opened during/post-COVID) = limited track record
- Small capacity = lower ticket volume per show
- Unknown event frequency (need to assess monthly show count)

**Next Steps:**
- Reach out to Kendra Smith or bookinginfo@sweetharmonycanal.com
- Assess monthly show volume and ticket sales
- Understand current Eventim contract terms and satisfaction level
- Explore private event ticketing needs (weddings, parties, etc.)
- Position Opendate as local alternative with better fees vs. European Eventim

**Assessment:**
Strong candidate for Opendate. Family-owned venue with community focus and identified decision-maker. Using Eventim (European platform) suggests they may be open to exploring local alternatives with better support and pricing. The multi-purpose model (music + events + vintage) shows entrepreneurial spirit and need for flexible ticketing solutions.
