## About

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 65/100 — Moderate Lead**

**Pros:**
- Active ticketed venue with regular programming
- Intimate setting (likely easier to convert from competitor platforms)
- Artist-first philosophy aligns with Opendate's values
- Small independent operation (faster decision-making)
- Mission-driven approach (inclusivity, community focus)

**Cons:**
- Small capacity = lower ticket volume per show
- Ticketing platform not identified (need to confirm current provider)
- Limited contact information available (no booking email found)
- Closed Sunday/Monday reduces weekly show potential

**Next Steps:**
- Identify current ticketing provider
- Find booking contact/decision-maker
- Assess monthly show volume and average ticket sales
- Understand revenue model (cover charge vs. ticketed shows)
- Explore if they do private events (additional ticketing opportunity)

**Assessment:**
Good fit for Opendate's artist-centric platform. Small venues like this often struggle with ticketing fees eating into already-thin margins. Opendate's competitive pricing could be appealing. The venue's commitment to supporting emerging and marginalized artists aligns well with a platform that prioritizes artist success.
