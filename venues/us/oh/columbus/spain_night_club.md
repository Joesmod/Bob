# Spain Night Club

## Overview
Listed as a nightclub in Columbus, OH. However, the provided website (nightflow.com) is actually a nightlife directory and dating site for partygoers, not the venue's actual website.

## Venue Details
| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Columbus, OH |
| **Type** | Night Club (presumed) |

## Website Issue
**INCORRECT WEBSITE** - The listing shows nightflow.com, which is a worldwide nightlife directory and "dating site for people who love to party" covering hundreds of cities. This is NOT the Spain Night Club's actual website.

Nightflow.com is a guide/directory platform that:
- Lists nightlife in 300+ cities worldwide
- Provides guest lists and tickets at various clubs
- Offers Buy-1-Get-1-Free deals
- Acts as a social network for partygoers

## Ticketing

|---|---|
| **Website** | Unknown (nightflow.com is incorrect) |

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 0/100 — Cannot Assess**

Unable to research venue due to incorrect website in database. Need actual venue website or social media to determine:
- If venue exists/is operational
- What kind of nightclub it is
- If they sell tickets for events
- Who manages/operates it

**Next Steps:**
- Search for "Spain Night Club Columbus Ohio" to find actual website
- Check Google Maps for business listing
- Look for social media presence (Instagram, Facebook)
- Verify venue is still operational
- Update database with correct website

**Note:** This entry appears to be a data quality issue in the original lead sheet.
