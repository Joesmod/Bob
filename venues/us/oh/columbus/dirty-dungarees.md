## Opendate Fit

**Score: 10/100 — Not a fit**

Wrong venue type for Opendate. This is a DIY underground music space that intentionally runs free shows as part of their community ethos. They do not sell tickets and operate on bar revenue. The whole vibe is anti-commercial "no BS" DIY punk scene. Not a ticketing opportunity.
