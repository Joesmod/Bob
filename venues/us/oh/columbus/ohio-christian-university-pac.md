## Research Status

**WEBSITE 404 ERROR - POSSIBLY INCORRECT URL**

The provided URL returns a 404 error. The domain "osugiving.com" suggests Ohio State University (OSU) giving/donations, not Ohio Christian University (OCU).

This appears to be a data quality issue where:
1. Wrong university (OSU vs OCU)
2. Wrong URL type (giving/donation page vs venue page)
3. Venue may not exist or may be part of a university that doesn't run ticketed public events

## Recommended Actions

1. Verify correct institution (Ohio Christian University vs Ohio State University)
2. Find correct website URL if venue exists
3. Determine if this is a public ticketing venue or university facility for students only
4. Remove from pipeline if it's university-only or non-ticketed

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Cannot assess**

Website unavailable. Even if venue exists, university performing arts centers typically don't switch ticketing providers easily (institutional contracts).
