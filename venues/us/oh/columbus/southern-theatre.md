## Opendate Fit
**Score: 20/100 — Not a Fit**
The Southern Theatre is operated by CAPA, a large, sophisticated nonprofit regional arts presenter that manages multiple theaters and has its own ticketing infrastructure. CAPA provides ticketing services to other organizations and has agreements with major touring entities like Broadway Across America. They are not a candidate for switching to a new ticketing platform - they have an established enterprise system and operate at a scale that requires significant custom infrastructure. Not in Opendate's target market of independent, smaller venues.
