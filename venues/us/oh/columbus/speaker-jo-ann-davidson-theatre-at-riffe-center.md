## Opendate Fit
**Score: 20/100 — Not a Fit**
This theater is operated by CAPA, a large nonprofit regional arts presenter with sophisticated ticketing infrastructure. Same organization as the Southern Theatre and other Columbus venues. CAPA has enterprise-level systems and is not a candidate for switching ticketing platforms. Not in Opendate's target market.
