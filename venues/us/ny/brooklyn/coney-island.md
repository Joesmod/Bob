# Coney Island USA

## Overview
Nonprofit arts organization and multi-arts performance space operating out of 1208 Surf Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Founded in 1980, the organization operates a circus sideshow, museum, performance venue, and bar in a historic 1917 Spanish Revival building (landmarked in 2011). Small-capacity venue focused on alternative/fringe arts, burlesque, sideshow, and cultural preservation.

## History
Founded in 1980 by Costa Mantis, Jane Savitt-Tennen, and Dick D. Zigun. Took possession of 1208 Surf Avenue building (built 1917) in 1996 and purchased it with NYC funding in 2008. The building was originally a Childs Restaurant, then served as a jazz nightclub (The Bluebird Casino), classic sideshow (David Rosen's Wonderland Sideshow), and arcades. Building granted NYC landmark status in 2011, making it the oldest structure in Coney Island protected by law.

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 45/100 — Low Priority**
Coney Island USA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit arts organization with a unique cultural mission focused on fringe arts, sideshow, and Coney Island heritage. While they do sell tickets to 8-12 events per month, their programming is very niche (burlesque, sideshow, classic films, drag) and they operate as a nonprofit cultural institution rather than a commercial venue. Small capacity, nonprofit structure, and specialized mission make them a marginal fit. They may prefer to maintain their current simple ticketing approach rather than switching to a new platform.
