## Opendate Fit

**Score: 10/100 — Not Viable**

⚠️ **DO NOT PURSUE**: Venue is in financial distress and may lose its space. Currently fundraising to "square up with artists and team" and dealing with potential foreclosure/lease cancellation. Not a stable prospect for new ticketing platform partnership.

**Status**: Monitor for potential reopening at new location, but not a current lead.
