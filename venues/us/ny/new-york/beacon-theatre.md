## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Poor Fit**

Not a viable prospect. This is a major corporate venue owned by MSG Entertainment (Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp), one of the largest entertainment companies in the world. They have exclusive contracts with Ticketmaster and are not independent operators. No decision-making authority at venue level.
