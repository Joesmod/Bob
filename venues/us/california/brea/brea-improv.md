## Research Limitations
The Brea Improv website showed limited venue-specific information on captured pages:
- No specific capacity details
- No current show listings captured
- No venue history or detailed "about" information
- No specific contact email or booking information
- No pricing information
- No staff or management details

Most pages redirected to newsletter signup or ticket warning. This suggests:
1. Heavy emphasis on direct ticket sales through official channels
2. Current show information likely behind additional page layers
3. Standard Improv chain operational model
4. Focus on preventing ticket fraud/scalping

More detailed information would require deeper website navigation or direct contact with venue.
