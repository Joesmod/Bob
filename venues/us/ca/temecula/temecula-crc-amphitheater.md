## Programming
City calendar shows primarily library programs and community events. No clear schedule of ticketed amphitheater performances found during research. Likely used for city-sponsored free events and occasional rentals.

## Ticketing
No evidence of regular ticketed events. Appears to be primarily a city-run community venue for free public programs and city events.

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 15/100 — Not a Good Fit**

**Why:**
- Municipal venue (government-operated)
- Limited or no regular ticketed programming
- City of Temecula control
- Appears to focus on free community events
- No clear commercial ticketing operation

**Recommendation:** Skip. City-owned community venue without clear commercial ticketing activity. May host occasional events but not a regular ticketed venue operation.
