## Opendate Fit
**Score: 5/100 — Not Applicable**

Event rental venue, not a ticketed entertainment space. Business model is renting the space to clients for private events (weddings, corporate gatherings, celebrations). No regular public programming or ticket sales. While the venue has excellent sound/projection capabilities and can accommodate live music, they don't produce or ticket their own shows.

**Recommendation**: Remove from ticketing lead pipeline. Not a fit for current Opendate platform.
