## About

Southern California's oldest and boldest opera company, founded over 45 years ago (~1980). Known for experimental, immersive productions that blend film, dance, and new music. Performs at various venues throughout Southern California rather than operating a single theater. Focus on contemporary opera, world premieres, and underrepresented voices. Administrative office in Long Beach.

## History

Founded around 1980 as Southern California's pioneering experimental opera company. Over 45+ years, LBO has built a reputation for risk-taking and innovation. Major milestone: commissioned and premiered Anthony Davis' "The Central Park Five" in 2019, which won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Also premiered Kate Soper's Pulitzer-finalist "The Romance of the Rose" in 2023. Under current leadership, has expanded into opera film festivals, dance company partnerships, and year-round development through LBO Studio.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 55/100 — Moderate Lead**

**Strengths**:
- Active opera company selling tickets to multiple productions per year
- Independent nonprofit with 45+ year history
- High-profile productions (Pulitzer Prize winners)
- Multiple revenue streams (tickets, galas, donations)
- Year-round programming and development activity

**Challenges**:
- **No owned venue** - performs at various rented spaces (complicates ticketing needs)
- **Nonprofit arts org** - may have limited budget for ticketing platforms
- **Small scale** - 2-3 productions per year (lower volume than commercial venues)
- **Specialized audience** - contemporary opera is niche market
- **May use venue-specific ticketing** - when performing at established theaters, likely uses their systems

**Consideration**: Better fit as a **secondary market** customer. They need ticketing, but volume is low and they don't control their venues. Might benefit from Opendate if platform offers: nonprofit pricing, donation integration, multi-venue capability, and subscriber/patron management. Worth a conversation if Opendate wants prestigious arts clients for portfolio, but ROI may be limited.
