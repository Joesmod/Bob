## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Established Nonprofit Theater**
Professional Equity theater with stable operations and a 46-year track record. They currently sell tickets online and via box office but ticketing platform is not identified on website. As a nonprofit with subscription programs and multiple discount tiers, they likely have an established ticketing system. However, nonprofits can be price-sensitive and may be interested in cost-effective solutions. Would need to identify current platform and pain points. Strong community presence and active calendar make them a potential fit if their current system isn't meeting needs.
