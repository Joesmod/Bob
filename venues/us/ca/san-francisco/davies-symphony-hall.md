## Context

Davies Symphony Hall is a well-known 2,743-seat concert hall in San Francisco's Civic Center. Home of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Major classical music venue with professional orchestra operations.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Symphony Orchestra (Not Target Market)**

Even with accessible website, Davies Symphony Hall operates as a major classical music institution with dedicated symphony operations. Likely using specialized classical music ticketing or corporate platforms. Not an independent venue that could switch to Opendate. Out of scope.
