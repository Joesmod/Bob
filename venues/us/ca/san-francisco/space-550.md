# Space 550

## Overview

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Not Venue Operator**

The listed website is for an event promoter, not a venue. Space 550 itself (if it exists as a venue) would need to be researched separately with correct contact information. Event promoters are not the target — venue operators are.
