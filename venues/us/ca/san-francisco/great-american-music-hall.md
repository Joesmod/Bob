## Opendate Fit

**Score: 58/100 — Good Prospect**

Well-established historic venue with very active calendar. Currently using SeeTickets for online ticketing. High volume of shows across diverse genres. The venue's connection to larger promoters (Another Planet/Goldenvoice) may complicate decision-making, but the venue itself would benefit from a more modern, integrated platform. Strong tourist and local draw in SF music scene.
