## Opendate Fit

**Score: 15/100 — Poor Fit**

CoLab Public House is a craft beverage venue (brewery/winery/bar) with free entertainment programming to drive food and drink sales. They do not sell tickets to events — their revenue model is based on F&B, not ticketing.

**Not a target for Opendate** — No ticketed events, community-driven free programming, hospitality business model.
