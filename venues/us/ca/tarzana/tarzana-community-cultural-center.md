## About

The Tarzana Community & Cultural Center is a community facility in a park-like setting dedicated to meetings, activities, and programs that nurture community spirit, the arts, education, and leadership. Located on Ventura Boulevard near Vanalden Avenue, the property features a 1940s Spanish-style home surrounded by pine trees.

Primarily a rental venue for community gatherings, meetings, private events (weddings, birthday parties, etc.), yoga classes, and educational events.

## History

The property was originally "Diane and Rudy's Garden Statuary" from the 1950s-1990s. In 2000, local resident Helen Baker donated funds to purchase the property and establish a community center. It opened in 2002.

The center is located near Edgar Rice Burroughs' historic Tarzana Ranch (creator of Tarzan), which gave the community its name.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Poor Fit**

This is a community center, not a professional entertainment venue. While they host monthly music nights, the programming is very limited (1 event/month at $5), volunteer-run, and community-focused rather than commercial.

**Not a target for Opendate** — Too small-scale, infrequent events, community-oriented rather than professional ticketing operation.
