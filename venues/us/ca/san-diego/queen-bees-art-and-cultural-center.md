## Opendate Fit
**Score: 85/100 — Strong Lead**

Strong candidate for Opendate. Active ticketed venue currently using Eventbrite (easily switchable). Diverse programming with consistent event schedule. Independent operation with founder/owner making decisions. Would benefit from Opendate's integrated platform for their regular ticketed shows, dance classes, and special events. Established venue with 18+ years of community presence and strong local following.

**Recommendation**: High priority contact. Owner Alma is accessible and has history of supporting local arts/tech. Eventbrite switch-out is straightforward for this use case.
