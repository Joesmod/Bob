## Opendate Fit
**Score: 0/100 — Not a Fit**

La Puerta is a restaurant and tequila bar, not a ticketed event venue. While they use "Tunes" in their tagline, there's no evidence of ticketed shows, events calendar, or performance programming. Their online presence focuses on food menus, drink lists, and online ordering. This is a dining/drinking establishment, not a venue for Opendate's ticketing platform.

**Recommendation**: Remove from sheet or mark as "Not a venue."
