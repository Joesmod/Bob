## About

Historic 2,400-seat auditorium at Pomona College in Claremont, CA. Built in 1931, designed by architect William Templeton Johnson in Northern Italian Renaissance style. Features a famous 22,000-square-foot ceiling mural by Giovanni Smeraldi depicting zodiac constellations. Considered one of Southern California's premier performing arts venues.

## History

Built in 1931 at a cost of $600,000 as a memorial to Mabel Shaw Bridges, who died in 1907 as a Pomona College student. Originally seated 2,500; now seats approximately 2,400 after 1975 renovation. The building won a Certificate of Honor from the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1933 for "exceptional merit." Has hosted partnerships with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra since October 1931.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 65/100 — Moderate Fit**

Large, prestigious venue with strong programming. However, as a college-owned facility, ticketing decisions likely go through institutional procurement processes. May use multiple platforms for different event types (college events vs. public rentals). Worth pursuing but expect longer sales cycle due to institutional decision-making.
