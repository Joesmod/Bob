## About

**⚠️ RESEARCH BLOCKED:** Website is non-functional. The site at offbeatbar.com only displays a cookie consent notice and returns 404 errors for all pages (including /about and /events). The homepage suggests following Instagram for daily updates, indicating social media may be the primary online presence.

Unable to determine venue type, capacity, programming, or ticketing information without a functioning website.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: N/A — Cannot Assess**

**Assessment:** Unable to research due to broken website. The venue appears to rely on Instagram for communication rather than maintaining a functional website, which suggests:
- Possibly a smaller, independent bar/venue
- Limited online infrastructure
- May not have sophisticated ticketing needs

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue until website is functional or social media research can be conducted. Consider deprioritizing — a venue without a working website may not be ready for ticketing platform integration.
