## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Not Target Market**
Magic Box is an event rental/production venue, not a ticketed entertainment venue. They focus on corporate events, trade shows, and festivals where the client handles ticketing (if any). Not a fit for Opendate's ticketing platform as they don't operate as a traditional box office venue.
