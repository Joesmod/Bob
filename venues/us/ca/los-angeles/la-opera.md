## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Poor Fit**

**Why Not a Good Lead**:
- **Does NOT own venue** - Performs at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (Music Center)
- **Venue-controlled ticketing** - Music Center likely uses Ticketmaster or similar enterprise system
- **No control over ticketing infrastructure** - Tenant company, not venue operator
- **Large institutional client** - Would require enterprise-level integration Music Center wouldn't switch for one tenant

**Reality**: LA Opera is a performing company, not a venue operator. They rent the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and use whatever ticketing system the Music Center (venue owner/operator) provides. Even if LA Opera wanted to switch platforms, they couldn't—ticketing is controlled by the venue. This is not a viable Opendate customer. Wrong type of organization entirely.
