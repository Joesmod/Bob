## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Established Professional Theater**
East West Players is a well-established, professional theater company with consistent programming and strong community presence. They perform at the Aratani Theatre and have an active calendar with regular ticketed events. As a nationally recognized arts organization, they likely have an established ticketing platform and box office operations. May be locked into existing contracts or satisfied with current system. However, if they're looking for better data/analytics, community engagement features, or cost savings, they could be a good prospect. Would need to identify current platform and decision-makers to assess switching potential.
