## Opendate Fit
**Score: 15/100 — Unlikely Fit**

Brickroom LA is primarily an event space rental business for private functions (weddings, corporate events, parties). While they mention "intimate concerts" as a potential use case, there's no evidence of regular public ticketed shows, events calendar, or concert programming. Their business model is based on private bookings and venue rentals, not public ticket sales.

Not appropriate for Opendate unless they pivot to hosting regular public concerts with their own programming.
