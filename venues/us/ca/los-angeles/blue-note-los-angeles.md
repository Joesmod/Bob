## Opendate Fit

**Score: 75/100 — Strong Lead**

Premier jazz club with consistent year-round programming. Part of the Blue Note global brand. Uses Tixr for major events (Jazz Festival) and likely TicketWeb for club shows. Independent booking operation with high-quality programming. Full-service venue with dining, bar, and live entertainment.

**Considerations**:
- Already using Tixr for major events (Blue Note Jazz Festival at Hollywood Bowl)
- May have established relationships with current platforms
- Part of larger Blue Note organization — decision may be corporate-level

**Recommendation**: Approach with focus on enhanced features for intimate jazz club setting, better integration with dining/VIP experiences, and potential cost savings vs. Tixr/TicketWeb combo.
