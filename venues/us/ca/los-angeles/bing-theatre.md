## Opendate Fit

**Score: 25/100 — Poor Fit / Not Target Customer**

This is an **academic/educational venue**, not a commercial ticketed venue:

**Why Not a Good Fit**:
- University-operated (not independent business)
- Primarily student productions (not professional ticketed shows)
- Likely uses university-wide systems for any ticketing
- Decision-making at institutional level
- Not revenue-focused (educational mission)
- Any ticketing decisions would require university IT/admin approval

**Recommendation**: Remove from active prospect list. This is not Opendate's target customer. Focus instead on independent commercial venues, performing arts centers, and mission-driven nonprofits that operate independently.

If targeting universities, would need to pitch at institutional level for all university venues, not individual theater spaces.
