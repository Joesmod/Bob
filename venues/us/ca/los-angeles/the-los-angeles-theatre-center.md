## Opendate Fit

**Score: 70/100 — Warm Lead**

**Strengths**: 
- Active year-round programming with robust season (8+ shows)
- Established nonprofit with long-term city lease through 2056
- Sells tickets at multiple price points ($10-$48)
- Strong community presence and mission-driven
- Five theaters = high venue utilization needs

**Considerations**:
- Currently using Squarespace-based ticketing (custom/integrated solution)
- Nonprofit theater company — may have unique requirements or budget constraints
- Strong identity and mission focus may prefer customizable platform
- Likely receives some public funding/grants given city lease

**Recommendation**: Good candidate for Opendate if platform can accommodate nonprofit pricing tiers, subscription series, and community access programs (free/reduced tickets). Their multiple venues and high production volume make them an ideal customer for an integrated ticketing system.
