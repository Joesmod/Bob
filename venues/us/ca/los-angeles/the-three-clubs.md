## Opendate Fit

**Score: 60/100 — Moderate Fit**

Established Hollywood venue with regular programming, but ticketing model unclear. Likely mix of cover charges and ticketed events. Bar-focused business may not have high ticketing volume. Worth exploring but not top priority unless they're actively seeking better ticketing tools for their theater/immersive productions.
