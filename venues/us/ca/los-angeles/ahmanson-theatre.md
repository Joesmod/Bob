## Ticketing
Center Theatre Group operates three major LA theaters and uses enterprise-level ticketing infrastructure. Likely AudienceView or similar large-scale platform.

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 5/100 — Not a Good Fit**

**Why:**
- Major professional theater company
- Part of LA's Music Center complex
- Enterprise-level operation
- Institutional/cultural landmark status
- Established ticketing infrastructure across multiple venues
- High production budgets and complexity

**Recommendation:** Skip. This is a major cultural institution, not an independent venue. Website failed to load during research, but this is clearly outside Opendate's target market.
