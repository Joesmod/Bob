## Ticketing

| | |
|---|---|

| **Business Model** | Rental venue - productions use their own ticketing |

As a rental venue, The Hudson Theatres does not handle ticketing centrally. Individual productions renting the space manage their own ticket sales.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 40/100 — Poor-Moderate Fit**

This is a **rental venue**, not a producing venue, which significantly impacts fit:

**Business Model Challenge**:
- Hudson doesn't produce shows or sell tickets directly
- They rent space to independent producers
- Each renter handles their own ticketing
- No centralized box office or ticketing operation

**Why Low Score**:
- Not the decision-maker for ticketing (renters are)
- Inconsistent ticketing (each production uses different systems)
- Would need to convince dozens of individual producers, not one venue
- No recurring ticketing revenue stream for Hudson itself

**Possible Angle** (Would require different approach):
- Could position Opendate as "preferred ticketing partner" for Hudson renters
- Offer discount to productions renting Hudson spaces
- Would need buy-in from Hudson management to recommend/require Opendate
- Similar to how venues sometimes partner with specific tech providers

**Recommendation**: Low priority unless pursuing a "rental venue network" strategy where you partner with rental spaces to offer their producers a preferred ticketing platform. This is a different sales motion than targeting producing venues.
