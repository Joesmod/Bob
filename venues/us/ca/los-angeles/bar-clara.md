## Opendate Fit
**Score: 0/100 — Not a Fit**

Bar Clara is a hotel rooftop bar, not a ticketed performance venue. While they host "Sunday Swim Club" with DJs, these are casual poolside events, not ticketed concerts. This is a hospitality/dining establishment within a Marriott hotel, not a venue appropriate for Opendate's ticketing platform.

**Recommendation**: Remove from sheet or mark as "Not a venue."
