## Opendate Fit

**Score: 30/100 — Poor Fit**

**Why Not a Good Lead**:
- **Educational institution** - Music conservatory and community school
- **Dual function** - Student events (free) + venue rentals (varied ticketing)
- **Institution-managed** - Part of Colburn School infrastructure
- **No independent control** - School policies govern operations

**Reality**: While they do host ticketed events (visiting artists, rentals), the venue is primarily an educational facility. Ticketing needs would be split between free student events and occasional paid performances. Educational institutions typically use campus-wide systems or venue rental clients bring their own ticketing. Not a strong commercial customer for Opendate.
