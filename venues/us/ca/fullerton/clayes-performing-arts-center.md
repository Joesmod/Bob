## Opendate Fit

**Score: 25/100 — Poor Fit**

**Why Not a Good Lead**:
- **Academic venue** - Part of CSUF College of the Arts (same as Meng Concert Hall)
- **Non-commercial** - Primarily student productions and academic programming
- **Institutional control** - University-managed, not independent
- **Limited commercial need** - Free/low-cost events don't require commercial ticketing platform

**Reality**: Academic facility, not a commercial venue. Same limitations as Meng Concert Hall (see that profile). Universities use institutional systems, not independent platforms. Not a viable Opendate customer.
