## Opendate Fit

**Score: 25/100 — Poor Fit**

**Why Not a Good Lead**:
- **Academic venue** - Part of a university music school
- **Non-commercial ticketing** - Primarily free or low-cost student/faculty performances
- **Institutional control** - University-managed, not independent operator
- **Limited commercial need** - Academic programming doesn't require sophisticated commercial ticketing platform

**Reality**: This is an educational facility, not a commercial venue. Most events are likely free or minimal cost for students/community. Universities typically use institutional systems (e.g., campus box office, Ticketmaster higher ed partnerships) rather than independent ticketing platforms. Not a viable commercial customer for Opendate.
