## Opendate Fit

**Score: 72/100 — Good Lead**

Active comedy club with professional ticketing operation. Currently using Shopify + ShowClix (switchable). Regular programming suggests consistent ticket sales. Food/beverage + ticket integration could be selling point for Opendate's platform. VIP and private events add complexity that might benefit from integrated solution. Worth pursuing.
