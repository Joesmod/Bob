## Opendate Fit

**Score: 15/100 — Poor Fit**

**Why Not a Good Lead**:
- **Community college facility** - Institutional venue rental model
- **Not a ticketing venue** - Rented out to organizations who bring their own ticketing
- **No independent programming** - Facility rental only
- **College-controlled** - Institutional policies govern use

**Reality**: This is a rental auditorium at a community college. Groups rent the space and handle their own ticketing/promotion. Pasadena City College doesn't sell tickets to events—they rent the space. Not an Opendate customer.
