## Opendate Fit

**Score: 78/100 — Good Fit**

Strong candidate with multiple revenue streams:

**Strengths**:
- Regular show schedule (multiple per week)
- Educational component (classes ranging $50-$299)
- Corporate training revenue
- Private events
- Independent operation (appears to be small business)

**Revenue Diversity**:
- Show tickets (PG-13 and mature audiences)
- Classes (8-week courses, workshops)
- Corporate workshops
- Private shows

**Platform Needs**:
- Ticket sales for shows
- Class registration and payment
- Corporate event booking/management
- Private show booking

This type of multi-format venue (shows + education + corporate) is ideal for an integrated platform. Currently seems to be managing these streams separately or with basic tools. Opendate could streamline operations significantly.

Classes ranging $50-$299 with 6-8 week commitments = recurring revenue and complex scheduling needs that a robust platform could handle better than simple solutions.
