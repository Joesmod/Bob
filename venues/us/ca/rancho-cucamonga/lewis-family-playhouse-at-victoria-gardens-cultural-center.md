## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Moderate Interest**
Professional 560-seat venue with active ticketing. City-owned/operated which may present decision-making challenges. Has existing ticketing system (proprietary). Good event volume and diverse programming. However, municipal ownership means budget constraints and bureaucratic approval processes. Would benefit from modern platform but procurement process may be complex.
