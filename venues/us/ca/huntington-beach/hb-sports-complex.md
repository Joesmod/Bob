## Opendate Fit
**Score: 5/100 — Not a Fit**

HB Sports Complex is a sports facility for leagues and tournaments. While they mention hosting "concerts" and "fundraisers" occasionally, there's no evidence of regular ticketed entertainment programming. Their business is sports field rentals and leagues, not concerts or performing arts.

Any concerts would be occasional special events, not regular programming that would justify a ticketing platform partnership.

**Recommendation**: Remove from sheet or mark as "Not a venue."
