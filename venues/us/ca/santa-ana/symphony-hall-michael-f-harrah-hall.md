## Opendate Fit
**Score: ??? — Unable to Assess**

Cannot evaluate without access to website. Likely a school performance hall that may host public ticketed events (student shows, concerts, recitals). Needs further research.

**Recommendations**:
1. Try alternative research methods (Google search, social media, phone contact)
2. Check if there's a public events calendar or box office info available elsewhere
3. Determine if they host regular public ticketed events vs. school-only performances
4. If public ticketing exists, assess current ticketing provider
