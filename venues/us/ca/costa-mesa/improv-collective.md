## Opendate Fit

**Score: 35/100 — Limited Fit**

Improv Collective is a small comedy troupe with a physical location in Costa Mesa. While they perform regularly and have strong reviews (4.8/5), the website provides minimal information about ticketing operations, show frequency, or capacity.

As a small-scale comedy collective (not a full venue operation), they may not have significant ticketing needs or volume to justify a platform switch.

**Possible consideration** if they:
- Host regular ticketed shows (weekly+)
- Have capacity >100
- Currently use online ticketing

**Needs follow-up** to assess current ticketing approach and show volume.
