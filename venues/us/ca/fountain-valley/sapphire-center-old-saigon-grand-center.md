## Opendate Fit
**Score: 10/100 — Not Applicable**

Event rental space, not a ticketed entertainment venue. They rent their spaces to clients who host their own events. No regular public programming or ticket sales. While clients might occasionally sell tickets to events held here, Sapphire Center itself is not in the ticketing business - they're in the venue rental business.

**Recommendation**: Remove from primary lead pipeline. Possibly relevant for "venue partners" category if Opendate ever builds B2B venue rental marketplace features, but not a fit for current ticketing platform.
