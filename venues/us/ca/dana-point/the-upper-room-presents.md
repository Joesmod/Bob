# The Upper Room Presents

## Overview
Nonprofit Christian ministry hosting faith-based live music and comedy events. 70-person capacity studio in Irvine; also uses Capo Beach Church in Dana Point for larger events. Founded in 2009 as a "non-churchy" venue for clean, family-friendly Christian entertainment.

## History
Founded in 2009 by Ron and Kathy Strand after hosting a speaker at their home group. First event outgrew their home, so they moved to an upstairs space in Ron's office building in Irvine - hence "The Upper Room." From 2010-2020, used The Rock venue in Mission Viejo. After COVID, shifted to Capo Beach Church for larger shows and built a 70-seat studio in Irvine for intimate events.

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 35/100 — Unclear Fit**

The Upper Room Presents is an active Christian entertainment venue with regular programming, but critical information is missing. Their website has no events calendar, no upcoming shows listed, and no visible ticketing integration. As a nonprofit ministry, they may operate on donations rather than ticket sales. The 70-person studio capacity is quite small.

Without evidence of:
- Regular ticketed shows
- Active events calendar
- Current ticketing platform
- Ticket prices

It's difficult to assess them as a lead. Would need direct outreach to understand their ticketing model and event frequency. May not be commercially oriented enough for a ticketing platform partnership.
