## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Niche Community Theater with Existing System**
LifeHouse currently uses a Ludus-based ticketing system (purchase.lifehousetheater.com) for ticket sales and season passes. They have 30,000+ annual attendees and active programming, indicating solid ticketing volume. However, as a volunteer-driven community theater with a faith-based mission, they may be cost-sensitive and satisfied with their current system. The niche market (Christian theater) and volunteer model could mean limited budget for ticketing upgrades. Worth exploring if they have pain points with Ludus or want better analytics/features, but switching costs may be a barrier.
