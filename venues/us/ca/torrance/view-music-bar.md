## Opendate Fit
**Score: 45/100 — Low Priority**

Weak fit for Opendate:
- ⚠️ Most events are free/RSVP (limited ticketing revenue)
- ⚠️ Small capacity (~150-200)
- ⚠️ No clear current ticketing platform to replace
- ⚠️ Focus on community events vs. touring acts
- ✅ Independent operation
- ✅ Regular programming

**Recommendation:** Low priority. This is more of a community venue/lounge than a ticketing-focused operation. Better targets exist in LA market.
