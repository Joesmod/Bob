## Opendate Fit
**Score: 60/100 — Municipal Venue - Restricted Access**
City-operated venue. Website blocked automated access. Municipal venues often have established systems through city contracts, which can make switching platforms complex. Would require direct contact with Torrance Cultural Arts department to assess ticketing needs and decision-making authority.
