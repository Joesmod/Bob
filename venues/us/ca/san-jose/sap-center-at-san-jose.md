SAP Center is a well-known major arena (home of NHL San Jose Sharks) with 17,000+ capacity for concerts and sporting events. Large corporate venue likely using Ticketmaster or AXS for ticketing.

## Opendate Fit

**Score: 0/100 — Major Arena (Not Target Market)**

Even if accessible, SAP Center is a major corporate arena likely under long-term contracts with Ticketmaster or AXS. Not an independent venue that could switch platforms. Out of scope for Opendate.
