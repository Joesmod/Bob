## Opendate Fit

**Score: 75/100 — Good Fit**

Established comedy club with regular programming and active ticket sales. Currently uses Etix (switchable platform). Strong candidate:
- High show frequency (multiple per week year-round)
- Clear ticket pricing structure
- Active online sales
- Name recognition (Jay Leno residency)
- Professional operation

Concerns:
- Already has strong anti-scalping/resale messaging, may have specific ticketing integrity needs
- Entertainment venue (not nonprofit) focused on profit margins
- May have negotiated rates with Etix

Would benefit from Opendate's integrated platform if it can match or improve on current Etix experience while reducing fees.
