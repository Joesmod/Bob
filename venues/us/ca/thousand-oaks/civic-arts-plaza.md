| **Online Platform** | Ticketmaster |

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 10/100 — Not a Good Fit**

**Why:**
- **Already uses Ticketmaster** — deeply integrated, likely long-term contract
- Major performing arts center with established infrastructure
- Subscription series management through Ticketmaster
- Multiple resident companies with existing workflows
- Institutional/municipal backing
- High switching costs

**Recommendation:** Skip. This is a major PAC using Ticketmaster with subscription series, resident companies, and institutional complexity. Not a realistic prospect for platform switch.
