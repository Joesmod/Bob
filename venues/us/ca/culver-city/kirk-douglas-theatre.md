Kirk Douglas Theatre is operated by Center Theatre Group, a major LA theatrical institution that likely has enterprise-level ticketing infrastructure centrally managed. Multi-venue organizations typically have established contracts and systems that are difficult to change at the individual venue level. Would require engaging with Center Theatre Group's central operations rather than venue-level staff.
