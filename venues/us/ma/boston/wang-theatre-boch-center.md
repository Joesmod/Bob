## Opendate Fit

**Score: 60/100 — Research Incomplete**

**Issue**: Website was completely inaccessible during research, preventing detailed analysis.

The Wang Theatre is a major institutional venue (3,600 capacity) which typically falls outside Opendate's target market of independent mid-sized venues. Large institutional theaters usually have established contracts with major ticketing providers (Ticketmaster, AXS, etc.) and complex governance structures that make platform switches difficult.

**Recommendation**: Revisit when website is accessible to verify scale and operational structure. If it's independently operated, it could be a good enterprise client. If it's part of larger institutional management, it's likely not a fit.
