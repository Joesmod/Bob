## Opendate Fit

**Score: 85/100 — Hot Lead** 🔥

**Why This is a Strong Lead**:
- **High event volume**: 4-6 ticketed shows per week = 200+ events/year
- **Currently using TicketWeb**: Switchable platform (Ticketmaster subsidiary, often expensive)
- **Independent operation**: Not a corporate chain, decision-making likely local
- **Established venue**: Part of legendary Boston music institution
- **Active programming**: Consistent calendar with regular recurring events
- **Genre fit**: Electronic/DJ events typically have good advance ticket sales

**Pitch Angles**:
- Cost savings vs. TicketWeb fees (Ticketmaster takes hefty cut)
- Better integration for multi-room complex (The Middle East has 4 rooms)
- Enhanced features for recurring events (House Party, themed nights)
- Local/independent platform vs. Ticketmaster corporate
- Better artist/promoter splits

**Decision Maker**: Likely venue management/ownership at The Middle East complex

**Recommendation**: **HIGH PRIORITY OUTREACH** — This venue has everything Opendate needs: volume, current ticketing platform (TicketWeb), independent operation, and consistent programming. Perfect candidate for platform switch.
