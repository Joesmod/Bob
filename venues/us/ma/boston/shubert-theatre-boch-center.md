## Opendate Fit

**Score: 40/100 — Low Priority**

Well-established nonprofit performing arts center with its own ticketing infrastructure. The Boch Center operates multiple historic venues and has significant institutional resources. Mission-driven organization focused on accessibility and community engagement. Likely to have vendor relationships and ticketing contracts in place. Not a typical independent venue profile — more of a major cultural institution. Low probability of platform switch without major institutional decision.
