## Opendate Fit

**Score: 60/100 — Solid Prospect**

Unique hybrid model: movie theater + live music venue. Active calendar with consistent ticketed events. Appears to use in-house ticketing system which could be ripe for modernization. Strong local following and diverse programming from art films to major touring acts. The venue would benefit from integrated ticketing across both film and live events. Multi-room setup could use sophisticated event management.
