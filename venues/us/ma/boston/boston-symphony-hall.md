## Opendate Fit

**Score: 35/100 — Low Priority**

Major institutional venue with established proprietary ticketing system. The BSO is a large nonprofit organization with sophisticated infrastructure. Unlikely to switch platforms. Not a typical Opendate customer profile — they have their own dedicated ticketing operation for a single resident orchestra.
