## Opendate Fit

**Score: 50/100 — International Government Entity**

State-operated theater as part of Nuevo León's cultural council. Active programming across theater, film, music, and cultural events. Government operation likely has established procurement processes and existing contracts.

**Considerations**:
- Government entity — formal RFP/procurement process likely required
- Mexican market — language, payment processing, regulatory compliance
- Part of larger CONARTE network with multiple venues
- May require Spanish-language platform support

**Recommendation**: Low priority unless Opendate has Mexican market strategy and government contracting capability. Could be explored if expanding into Latin American cultural institutions.
