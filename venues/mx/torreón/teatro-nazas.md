## Opendate Fit

**Score: 60/100 — Moderate Prospect**

Active performing arts theater with regular ticketed programming. Good reputation (4.7/5 stars). Mix of symphonic concerts, tribute shows, and contemporary acts. However, Mexico market challenges apply: language, payments, need for Spanish platform. Appears to be independent operation, which is positive. Would need regional market expansion strategy.
