## Opendate Fit

**Score: 20/100 — Poor Fit**

Government-operated venue (Instituto Sinaloense de Cultura). State-run theaters typically have bureaucratic procurement processes, little flexibility in choosing vendors, and decisions made at administrative levels far removed from the venue. Website infrastructure issues suggest tech adoption challenges. Not a viable independent prospect for Opendate.
