## Opendate Fit

**Score: 65/100 — Moderate Prospect**

Active ticketed venue using Boletero (regional Mexican platform). Good volume of business based on reviews. However, Mexico market presents challenges: language barrier, different payment infrastructure, and Opendate would need Spanish support. Venue appears independent and actively books talent, which is positive. Would require market expansion strategy for Mexico.
