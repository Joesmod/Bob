# Prohibition Lounge

## Overview
Prohibition is San Diego's original speakeasy bar, featuring a hidden entrance behind a faux law office door in the Gaslamp Quarter. The venue recreates 1920s Prohibition-era atmosphere with masterfully-crafted cocktails and live music in an underground, exclusive setting. Operating as both a bar and private event venue, Prohibition specializes in intimate, curated experiences with no reservations or call-aheads - guests simply show up and find the secret entrance.

## History
Prohibition is described as "San Diego's original speakeasy," suggesting it pioneered the speakeasy concept in San Diego's nightlife scene. The venue has established itself as a destination for those seeking an authentic 1920s Great Gatsby experience. The entrance is deliberately hidden behind a "Law Office" door, maintaining the speakeasy mystique.

## Opendate Fit
**Score: 42/100**

**Strengths:**
- Part of GBOD Group (6+ related venues) = potential for multi-venue deal
- Strong brand identity and unique positioning
- Private event capability suggests additional revenue streams
- Established presence in San Diego nightlife scene
- Eventbrite usage for special events shows willingness to use ticketing platforms

**Opportunities:**
- Walk-in only model could benefit from limited reservation/ticketing system
- Private events likely need booking/payment management
- Special cocktail dinner events already using Eventbrite
- Multi-venue group ownership creates opportunity for portfolio approach

**Challenges:**
- **Primary model is walk-in bar, not ticketed events** - limited ticketing need
- "No reservations" is a deliberate brand choice, not a limitation
- Speakeasy mystique contradicts advance ticketing model
- Bar revenue (cocktails) likely far exceeds any potential ticketing revenue
- Eventbrite usage is minimal (special events only)

**Why Opendate (Limited):**
Prohibition represents a challenging fit for ticketing software because their core business model is walk-in bar service, not ticketed events. The "no reservations" policy is a branding feature, not a bug - it creates exclusivity and mystique.

**However, there are narrow opportunities:**
1. **Private event management**: Corporate events, parties, buyouts could benefit from booking/deposit/ticketing system
2. **Special cocktail dinners**: Already using Eventbrite for these - could switch for better margin
3. **Multi-venue group deal**: GBOD Group operates 6+ venues; a portfolio approach might make sense if other venues have stronger ticketing needs

**Recommendation:** This is a low-priority individual lead due to limited ticketing use case. However, worth researching GBOD Group's other venues to determine if a portfolio deal makes sense. Focus on:
- Havana 1920 (likely similar speakeasy model)
- Gaslamp Meze (restaurant/event space)
- Other group venues that may have higher ticketing volume

If pursuing, position Opendate as:
1. Private event booking and deposit management system
2. Special event ticketing (dinners, tastings, experiences)
3. Group portfolio management with unified reporting across venues

The speakeasy mystique is their brand - respect it. Don't try to "fix" their walk-in model.
